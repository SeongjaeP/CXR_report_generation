"Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate normal lung volumes without pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax."
"Focal opacity within the left upper lobe is concerning for pneumonia."
"Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax."
"Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present with trace right pleural effusion persisting."
"Again, there are low lung volumes."
"Linear opacities in the left mid to lower lung are not significantly changed, likely minimal scarring."
"2 views of the chest:  The lungs are well expanded and show bilateral middle lobe opacities."
"The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature."
"There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax."
"The lungs are clear without consolidation, effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion."
"Elsewhere, the lungs are clear."
"The lungs are clear without focal consolidation."
"Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax."
"The lungs are clear."
"There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax."
"Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe estimated 10 cm in widest AP dimension, similar as compared to ___."
"Again noted, are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right."
"The lungs are well expanded and clear."
"Small bilateral pleural effusions which are partially loculated laterally, right greater than left, appear slightly increased in size compared to the prior study."
"This is most consistent with multifocal pneumonia."
"No pneumothorax."
"There is mild left basilar atelectasis."
"There is mild interstitial edema."
"Subtle bibasilar opacities seen on the frontal view, not substantiated on the lateral view, may be due to atelectasis and overlying vascular structures although a residual pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting."
"There are low lung volumes."
"There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely representing large effusion and underlying atelectasis /consolidation."
"The lungs are clear."
"The lungs are well expanded and clear."
"The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pulmonary edema."
"The heart is normal in size and the lungs are clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion."
"There is a small right pleural effusion."
"More confluent opacity at the right lung base, similar to prior, could represent overlying vasculature, although underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting."
"Lungs are hyperinflated without focal consolidation."
"The lungs are well expanded and clear."
"There is a right lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia."
"No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is present."
"Moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged since the prior study, and is associated with adjacent basilar atelectasis."
"There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax."
"The lungs are clear."
"No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen."
"Moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion are increased in size from chest radiograph ___."
"No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen."
"PA and lateral views of the chest provided demonstrate no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax."
"Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis."
"The lungs are low in volume with linear right greater than left basal atelectasis."
"There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax."
"There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax."
"The lungs are essentially clear."
